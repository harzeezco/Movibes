## Overview

### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harzeezco/Movibes.git

```

- Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
npm run lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
npm run lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

and to have it actually fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
npm run format
```

You can also check against HTML Validator:

```bash
npm run html-validator
```

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for Movies
- Check Movie Details
- Add Movie to Watched list
- Rate Movie 
- Like the Movie
- Delete Movie from Watched list
- **Bonus**: Sort watched movies
